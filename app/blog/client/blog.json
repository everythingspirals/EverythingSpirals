I was able to get things working, but I never gave myself the chance to really understand how they worked (more on this in a later post).</p><p>Initially I was going to develop this in MeteorJS. However, after reading several complaints about performance, and feeling generally uncomfortable about putting all my eggs into one high-level basket, I opted to build everything from scratch. This has turned out to be a very enriching experience. Nowadays we are seeing Front-End frameworks rise and fall at an alarming rate. Many developers are struggling to decide which bandwagon to jump onto, be it ReactJS, AngularJS, Backbone, Meteor, Knockout, etc.</p> <p>My feeling is this--who knows what the landscape will be in two years, better to decouple as much as we can, that way when the next shiny new MV* gets announced on Hacker News, we can swap it out without having to rewrite our entire application. This, in my opinion, is the greatest weakness of MeteorJS, while at the same time being its greatest appeal--a framework that handles everything.</p>",
