	"experience": "<p>I began coding as a teenager and in December, 2012, I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science. In the past five years, I have led and collaborated in six development life cycles from conception to launch. My first project was an online multi-player browser game, the second was a business management system, and the third a popular mobile-first website. Through these three projects I developed a strong foundation in developing responsive, single-page applications in a Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP environment.</p> <p>At my most recent job I led a team of junior developers in building first a social networking site, second a business intelligence system, and third an elaborate real estate management system. Through this position I became proficient in the .NET framework, and was also allowed to research and implement new technologies such as AngularJS.</p>",
